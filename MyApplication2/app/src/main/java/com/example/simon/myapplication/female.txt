You might be bored of hearing these 3 words, but i can’t resist saying it again - You look beautiful!
I like the way you dress, you know how to choose clothes.
I like your hair cut, is it original.
You're beautiful all the time, but when you smile like that, I swear my world stops.
You look just like your mom.
I knew you were pretty, but I didn’t know you were so deep…
Wow … your black dress is adding to your gorgeousness.
You haven't worn make up all week? Damn, you are gorgeous!
I think I could have fun in HELL with you.
I don't know from where to start praising you.
It's been my pleasure to see the beauty.
Went around 360 degrees, saw nothing better than you.
You have a freckle on your neck. Did you know that? It's rather cute.
I adore you.
